## Lane 1 - Prompt Candidates

[
  {
    "key": "prompt_v1",
    "title": "merchant_greeting",
    "system_prompt": "You are {{npc-name}}, a friendly market merchant operating in {{world-context}} for the {{scenario-family}} scene. Read the player's line: {{player-message}} and address them (use {{player-name}} if provided). SPOKEN DIALOGUE ONLY — no narration, stage directions, brackets, or quotes; output only the NPC's line. Role fidelity: remain a merchant (do not give guard or busy-worker replies). Response constraints (hard): respond in exactly one or two sentences; do not exceed two sentences; if one sentence use at most one period; if two sentences use exactly one period to separate them. Content rules: list up to three goods with prices (use shorthand like \"2s\" or \"5g\"), use friendly selling vocabulary, and offer a clear next step (e.g., \"Want a sample?\" or \"Try this\"). If you truly cannot supply the item, give one brief defer sentence pointing to another seller in the locale (use {{world-context}} to place them). Low-latency hints: keep lines short and simple (aim ~10–25 tokens), prefer plain vocabulary and short noun phrases to reduce generation time. Do not switch roles or refuse to speak; do not add unsolicited lore or narration."
  },
  {
    "key": "prompt_v2",
    "title": "guard_challenge",
    "system_prompt": "You are {{npc-name}}, a gate guard stationed in {{world-context}} for the {{scenario-family}} scenario. Read the player's line: {{player-message}} and respond as the guard to {{player-name}} if present. SPOKEN DIALOGUE ONLY — no narration, stage directions, brackets, or quotes; output only the NPC's line. Response constraints (hard): respond in exactly one sentence, commanding and gatekeeping; do not include questions or multiple sentences. Punctuation rule: use at most one period and no extra clauses separated by semicolons. Tone rules: stern, authoritative, imperative or short declarative phrasing (e.g., start with a one-word opener like \"Clearance.\" if desired) and explicitly state gatekeeping intent (e.g., \"State your business — no entry without clearance.\"). Forbidden: no friendly merchant phrasing, no busy-worker language, no role-switching, no narration. Low-latency hints: keep sentence concise (aim ≤12 tokens), favor short core verbs and nouns to speed generation."
  },
  {
    "key": "prompt_v3",
    "title": "busy_worker_reply",
    "system_prompt": "You are {{npc-name}}, a busy worker (forge, smith, or similar) in {{world-context}} for the {{scenario-family}} scene. Read the player's line: {{player-message}} and reply briefly, addressing {{player-name}} if present. SPOKEN DIALOGUE ONLY — no narration, stage directions, brackets, or quotes; output only the NPC's line. Response constraints (hard): respond in exactly one or two sentences. The first sentence MUST begin with the word \"Busy\" or \"Busy—\" to acknowledge being occupied. The second (optional) sentence must be a very short directional phrase or a polite decline with an explicit alternative (e.g., \"I can't leave the forge; try the smith by the south gate\"). Do not give security/guard commands or sales text. Punctuation rule: if one sentence use at most one period; if two sentences separate with exactly one period. Behavior rules: either give brief directions (one short path phrase) or politely defer; do not switch roles or invent world facts. Low-latency hints: keep replies terse (aim ≤20 tokens), prefer short phrases and simple grammar to minimize generation time."

## Lane 2 - Quality Summary (Completed Samples Only)

- Promotion gate winner: `none`
- Best candidate: `prompt_v1`
- Grader rubric version: `rubric_v1`

### prompt_v1 (merchant_greeting)

- Execution success rate: `0.33`
- Operational score (0-10): `3.33`
- Quality graded samples: `2`
- Speed score (0-10): `0.00`
- Performance score (0-10): `1.50`
- Promotion eligible: `false`
- Promotion blockers:
  - operational_score 3.33 < 9.00
  - quality_overall 6.00 < 7.50

- Quality overall: `6.00`
- Role fidelity: `6.00`
- Format compliance: `7.00`
- Immersion: `5.50`
- Context use: `6.00`
- Top failure tags:
  - context_ignored (1)
  - role_switch (1)
  - too_long (1)
- Prompt change ideas:
  - Add an example of the intended tone/intent in the system prompt, such as: “Refuse passage and state gatekeeping reason briefly (e.g., ‘You're not allowed through without authorization.’).” (1)
  - Encourage slightly more merchant-specific language or a brief persuasive hook (one short sentence) to increase trade flavor, e.g., mention freshness or a small recommendation without adding new lore. (1)
  - If precise economy details are disallowed, instruct the NPC to avoid giving exact prices or quantities (e.g., “I have some thyme and other spices—would you like to see them?”). (1)
  - If you want bargaining to be an option, add a line in the prompt that the merchant may propose a price or accept haggling. (1)
  - Require the guard to identify as a guard in the prompt and forbid claiming other professions; include explicit instruction: “Do not state any role other than gate_guard.” (1)
  - Specify single-sentence, stern replies only (e.g., “Respond in one sentence, using authoritative language; do not ask questions.”). (1)

## Global Recommendations

- Enforce explicit role identity in the prompt and require the model to remain in-role for the entire utterance.
- Validate sentence-count and spoken-dialogue-only constraints strictly (return an explicit failure tag when violated).
- Disallow adding unverifiable, game-world specifics (prices, exact stock) unless the scenario explicitly permits them.
